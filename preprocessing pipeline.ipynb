    "This capstone looks at tweets from a 5-year period of the CEOS of several companies. Their respective stocks are collected and the tweets are analyzed to determine if the closing price of a stock can be determined from the CEO's tweets. The CEOs, their twitter username, and their associated stocks are as follows:  \n",

    " - Aaron Levie : '@levie': Box (BOX)\n",
    " - Jack Dorsey : '@jack': Twitter (TWTR)\n",
    " - Marc Benioff : '@Benioff': Salesforce (CRM)\n",

    " - John Legere: @JohnLegere: T-Mobile (TMUS)\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "These CEOs were selected with the following criteria:  \n",
    " - the stock must be a publicly traded company for at least 5 years.\n",
    " - the CEO must have tweeted at least 500 times over that span of that 5 years.\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "## Objective: \n",
    "\n",
    "To scrape the tweets and stocks from the CEOS, clean these data by standardizing dates and times, dealing with null values, and then to combine these cleaned dataframes into a single dataframe for EDA and machine learning. All datetimes are in EST."

If so can they still all be Magenta?  https://t.co/0Jdm9iGjo2 As long as people continue to say they are sandwiches, I will continue to debate! 🌭🥪  https://t.co/tmkfHfvUJK @1ofdakoolkidz @dandrake0224 @JonFreier @MikeSievert @TracyNolan_ @marceloclaure @shoe_stars 👀 @BCAppelbaum @Theophite hear you and we\\'re on it! Enterprise software design has always traditionally lagged consumer technology, by years. Now, we’re regularly seeing enterprise software that is more thoughtful and simple than the consumer space. We’re still early, but this is an incredible trend. If you have to stop streaming @ArianaGrande, you’re clearly lost!

Where would I put @LegereDoll’s ego?!?  https://t.co/6ffxrdGvUo Hmm, do you think I could make a @TMobile logo??? 🤔 https://t.co/klm4dRWMWq @JonAttenborough @cFidd Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them. @ollie_turrell @cFidd Pretty much @Snipergen @Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version. @cFidd No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is. @RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted. @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net. @amargosavalley Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting. @ToscaMusk @kimbal ❤️ you too sis @SMZGallagher @Tesla Sorry about this. We will do our best. The Tesla production &amp; delivery teams have been working super hard. @JohnnaCrider1 @mayemusk Literally. It was at 40th &amp; Baltimore in Philadelphia before gentrification. @JaneidyEve @johnkrausphotos @austinbarnard45 @flcnhvy @Joe__Wakefield @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo Ramones &amp; Bach @johnkrausphotos @austinbarnard45 @flcnhvy @Joe__Wakefield @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo I hope someone has pics! My Mom came to visit one weekend &amp; was quite surprised by it all, but helped work coat check &amp; guarded the cash with a kitchen knife 🤣🤣 @austinbarnard45 @flcnhvy @Joe__Wakefield @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo To pay rent, we turned our house into a nightclub &amp; charged a $5 entry fee. Looked cool at night, but insane by day … blacklights, luminescent spray paint &amp; metal junk sculptures. @kimbal 🖤 you too @catmonocle69 Sounds like a Marxist with style @flcnhvy @cyrusposting Exactly @cyrusposting Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone. @Joe__Wakefield @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship &amp; debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton &amp; Stanford. @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal? @IrinaAntony @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).  My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round would’ve happened anyway. @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo He didn’t own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from? @geofficient Pretty much @annerajb @justpaulinelol Federal @justpaulinelol @annerajb Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals. @annerajb Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.

Other variants will have throttle. @bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year. @bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force! @jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much @leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far). @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go? @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city @Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard. @flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half @flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year @RPMTESLA Would be good to look up electricity rates by location &amp; optimize cost automatically @tesla_truth Yeah, they were a little off the mark  https://t.co/yqZhvkbdrt @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Fun! @cleantechnica Applies to a small number of Bay Area residents, but worth checking out Hopefully a lot of this comes in magenta 🥶  https://t.co/U4SxbQIbZI Meet Tobias, a 7-year-old Chihuahua who enjoys walks outside in between his couch potato time 🛋🥔 Head to @SeattleHumane to meet him today! @Jesspenafornes @JonFreier @JEMartel @WencyBaerga @cburgos72 @solcorujo wooo hoo!!!

My greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid &amp; full reusability, without which we shall forever be confined to Earth. @Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp) @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Higher Isp too @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; they’re already there @brendan2908 @NASASpaceflight Yes @mikko @Darudevil It’s true!

Deaths should be broken out as died with vs died of. @teslaownersSV @kimbal Deaths continue to trend down  https://t.co/FsZNwkvs1H @kimbal We’re seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives, in range of 5% to 10%. Article says testing went from 100k to 600k, which means a 6-fold increase in false positives. My guess is most cases, especially “no symptoms”, are false positives. @WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave Yes @flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave The news is sometimes created, but always curated. The latter is most pernicious. On any given day, there are thousands of potential stories. By picking which stories are written about &amp; how prominently they’re placed, a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative. @flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave Klippenstein has gone full twitter troll.

I don’t use FB &amp; never have, so don’t think I’m some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don’t advertise or pay for endorsements, so … don’t care. @themadstone Ok @mcwm What, a troll, me!? How dare you, sir! @kerrymflynn Yeah, my fault for being an idiot.

Will improve a lot in coming months. @slye @LivingTesla @Tesla Impressive analysis @LivingTesla @Tesla Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we’ll add a setting to disable internal camera. @LivingTesla @Tesla Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows &amp; rear window. @LivingTesla @Tesla It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet.

This is the first use on Twitter 👇🏼  https://t.co/iIJNRpcikT @Gfilche 😉 @flcnhvy Tesla is responsible for 2/3 of all the personal &amp; professional pain in my life combined. But it was worth it. So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all. 2019: Why in the world do we still own a printer at home, this is a complete waste of space.  2020: This is the most important asset we own, and I will barter with you to use it right now.

Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps. @yourloyalpal @SComet04 @WSJ Deal Please support my campaign to rebrand @WSJ as 🧦 emoji! @AustinOnSocial @TheOnion 🔥🔥💕💕💫💫😀😀 At some point, @TheOnion and I should just a get a room … @techreview Just use this handy guide  https://t.co/wWZGuNpe5f @sanjeev_r11 @cleantechnica @lexfridman Yes @cleantechnica Good interview by @lexfridman @Louisbotelho17 @Kristennetten @arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement Truth @johnrobb Exactly @Kristennetten @arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement How embarrassing.

They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels … @langstonwertzjr @TMobile email me to experience the best!  John.Legere@T-mobile.com Thank you @AGRutledge!

Can’t wait to see everybody decked out in magenta tmrw!! #UnlimitedPride  https://t.co/mW4Pvdwahr @theLJreal ☺️ Keep your eyes out for magenta this weekend! Proud to support the #LGBTQ community!! #UnlimitedPride  https://t.co/8YkcJ0sQxT For all those people (me) who take hundreds of photos at a time.  https://t.co/nvkCqt3OdV Life goals, #amiright?  https://t.co/gIH0ZDC8gh It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler. @karaswisher Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse. @kenlacovara Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly) Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible? @SeanGVarney That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term. We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far … Artificial intelligence.  https://t.co/jo7CLUSNEg Congrats @babson #1 entrepreneur program on your amazing new Salesforce applicant admissions platform!   https://t.co/CmyCdGkcMH  https://t.co/uQNrs6kGfG You can achieve great career success and change the world at the same time – @HollyBranson’s book #WEconomy shares how  https://t.co/PJDNR0vCMX @MarcKielburger @CraigKielburger  https://t.co/04tZ9rnLWb .@HollyBranson’s book WEcomony shares how when purpose and profit are combined, it has the power to change the world  https://t.co/PJDNR0vCMX @MarcKielburger @CraigKielburger  https://t.co/pcLqorIZoI So proud of @HollyBranson for writing her first book #WEconomy  https://t.co/PJDNR0vCMX  https://t.co/D2QH8VvzXQ The entrepreneurial creative process an idea goes through:  https://t.co/eiyYbupNR5 #MondayMotivation  https://t.co/972qDeQSWT Voted!

Hawthorne is working on SN5 now, but focus is ramping build rate of SN6 through SN10. @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight The opposite. Any insights gained by one team must be shared with the other, but other team not required to use them. @space_terp @NASASpaceflight Both sites will make many Starships. This is a competition to see which location is most effective. Answer might be both. @NASASpaceflight SpaceX is doing simultaneous competing builds of Starship in Boca Chica Texas &amp; Cape Canaveral Florida @Robotbeat @justpaulinelol @Teslarati Sure. Have to do it on Mars from beginning. Will ultimately do that on Earth too, so rocket flights will be zero net carbon long-term. @TeslaTested @Teslarati Next quarter @TeslaTested @Teslarati Will discuss with my product team next week, but probably @justpaulinelol @Teslarati Yes @Teslarati Great work by SpaceX parachute engineering! The Crew Dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may seem.

As I read it, this wasn’t a call for civil war (author used as a provocative metaphor) or a one party system (author states both parties still exist), but a bunch of learnings and warnings for both parties. I disagree both parties can’t work together. I thought this was a strong analysis and thesis of competing economic systems in the past (labor) and today (energy), where one ideology had to win completely to move us all forward. I’ve been getting a lot of critical feedback on this tweet. Fair. I should have provided more context why I thought it was a “great read.”  https://t.co/JH2Wbs36nP @amyklobuchar @MarkWarner We’re supporting:  https://t.co/1SvLpwiQfP @MarkWarner @facebook @Google @Twitter @amyklobuchar We’re doing it:  https://t.co/1SvLpwiQfP @tommyb562 @SquareCash Wow, this is really cool It’s time everyone stopped millennial bashing  https://t.co/HvmyBbQK6U #ReadbyRichard  https://t.co/XMsGEtNtQa You can learn a lot from your parents – I share what my dad taught me in #FindingMyVirginity  https://t.co/PFBge4TVB8  https://t.co/fRzQcct6PX I share how my dad taught me to be a father and a man in this exclusive excerpt from #FindingMyVirginity  https://t.co/PFBge4TVB8  https://t.co/6MwejvSlYS Isn’t life wonderful?

Please spend at least 8 seconds checking your facts. @businessinsider Just because I have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn\\'t make me a ninja. That requires years of training. @VatsalSngh @businessinsider There are dozens of bogus or half-true anecdotes don\\'t really matter &amp; maybe 5 to 10 that do. Guess I could post for those interested. @businessinsider One other I\\'d like to correct from the biography: I never said I was a samurai. Said I was ninja. No, that\\'s a joke. Didn\\'t say that either. @businessinsider MB was given 52 weeks of salary &amp; stock in appreciation for her great contribution &amp; left to join a small firm, once again as a generalist @businessinsider Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over 10 yrs, but as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs one generalist @businessinsider Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense. @businessinsider Ashlee Vance\\'s biography is mostly correct, but also rife with errors &amp; never independently fact-checked, despite my request that he do so Thank you @CoryBooker @PattyArquette @DarrenAronofsky @Neilyoung for visionary humanitarian leadership on #NoDAPL.  https://t.co/ttXptWKhI0 Congratulations @adidas for showing all of us the way forward together as Trailblazers.   https://t.co/zNzNeExnyd Strange, but true Bitcoin\\'s energy use is expected to double again by the end of the year, according to a new peer-reviewed study out Wednesday.

As tech grips our society we must demand absolute transparency into how tech is being used for OR against us. We can no longer assume Tech leaders are self regulating. @LaurieSegallCNN  https://t.co/kkGQn60QCK Every CEO must now ask themselves if Trust is their highest value.

An always-in-your-pocket device will never be safe enough to be solely responsible for your bitcoin. Whether through accidental loss, theft, or in worst cases coercion, having some friction here is beneficial. What’s the right friction? With that, @jessedorogusker, I, and team will listen and continue the conversation. And we’ll set up a dedicated Twitter and github account if we decide to build. We’ll update this thread with that information when we’re ready. Thanks! 12/Cash App integration is obvious for us but only part of the solution. A smooth experience likely depends on a custom-built app but it doesn’t need to be owned by Square. We can imagine apps that work without Square and maybe also without permission from Apple and Google. You? 11/Layer 2 is essential for growth. The orders-of-magnitude growth we imagine requires a mix of custodial, off-chain, and second layer solutions that allow people to ‘get off of 0.’ What tech investments can enable seamless, scalable, L2 native support for a hardware wallet? 10/Trust can’t be required. Today, customers depend heavily on the continued function of infrastructure provided by 3rd parties. We want mainstream customers to be able to lean on us when they want to, but we won’t exclude those who don’t. How should we think about this flow? 9/Are small displays necessary? Expecting mainstream customers to validate details on a small display is *unlikely* to increase security and *likely* to reduce device reliability, increase device cost, and decrease accessibility. Is the product better if a display isn\\'t required? 8/Today’s recovery mechanisms burn money. Customers have to protect recovery information from damage, loss, and theft and store secret(s). In practice, this is not yet mainstream-ready. We don’t want more passwords on post-its. What best of class solutions should we consider? 7/Safety is complicated. For any wallet product, we consider safety failures to stem from one of three types of events: availability failures (“sunken gold”), security failures (“pirated gold”), and discretionary actions (“confiscated gold”). What threats are we missing? 6/Blend availability and security. Make it easy for customers to keep the funds they want quick access to at their fingertips, spendable with phone-only permissions, while keeping the remainder under tighter, less available but more secure controls. What’s the right balance? 4/Most people access the internet on mobile. Any solution we build must provide an excellent experience when using mobile, despite its shortcomings and liabilities. An uncompromising focus on mobile interaction is likely to include the most people. What are the dangers here? 4/Most people access the internet on mobile. Any solution we build must provide an excellent experience when using mobile, despite its shortcomings and liabilities. An uncompromising focus on mobile interaction is likely to include the most people. What are the dangers here? 3/Custody doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing. We can probably simplify custody through “assisted self-custody.” Assisted requires great product design: minimal setup time, relying on existing devices, and end-to-end reliability. How should we be thinking about assisted solutions? 2/“No keys, no cheese.” The exchange you used to buy your bitcoin probably attends to your security with good intent, but circumstances may reveal “custody” actually means “IOU.” Deciding to take custody, and security, of your bitcoin is complicated. What’s the #1 problem here? 1/Bitcoin is for everyone. It’s important to us to build an inclusive product that brings a non-custodial solution to the global market. Much respect to everyone who has gotten us this far. What are the biggest blockers to get a non-custodial solution to the next 100M people? Square is considering making a hardware wallet for #bitcoin. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community. We want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles. @fjpou @Google @TMobile You need to check out our deals then! @ManUpGary You’ll have to follow me for that! @Rschiedel @TMobile  https://t.co/kFFGd0AUdx #LIVE @TMobile CEO: Happy Sunday!

A complicated one is relatively easy. @WorldAndScience Love this design. Simpler the better. @DeeLex_MCEM @VHollywood21 Add an R for Roadster 👽💕🚀 @raptorweb Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially. @Off_thewalls @MKBHD @joerogan A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady. @VHollywood21 Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing. @MKBHD Will do @bartjehoel @djenkins6 Correct, pure electric.

Stainless mirror finish.

People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth’s gravitational reach is infinite. “Zero gravity” is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.

Thanks for being there @Virgin @VirginOrbit Brilliant. In a world driven by data and analytics, there should always be a place for human instinct. Here’s my thoughts:  https://t.co/wk2f9O5HfK  https://t.co/dJJ6AEGNQd @28delayslater @justpaulinelol Dogecoin Mode @PPathole @CBSNewYork @AielloTV Great @harsha_irugu 👍 🤣 @CBSNewYork @AielloTV Heard same from doc I trust @yourfavgas @justpaulinelol No, good chance of RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event, but landing pad is separated from launch pad @justpaulinelol That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change! So often true 🤣🤣  https://t.co/qxmDtZ4Buf @brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time &amp; reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production. @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight These won’t be strictly coupled to ship serial number. Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder. @PPathole Great labeling tools &amp; talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools &amp; infrastructure is underrated. @jh_csquared @AlexBrendel2 @Erdayastronaut As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is &gt;1000% harder than designing it @RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It’s also because of the Spitfire engine &amp; wizard @PPathole Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term. @jgrano305 @thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica Progress is good @thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica Definitely @cleantechnica Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame &amp; actuation. @DMC_Ryan @RenataKonkoly Sure, we can probably do an update later this year @Kristennetten @PPathole @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers Needs to be more than halfway to east coast @PPathole @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers Not saying new Giga will be in Texas, but Cybertruck will be produced there wherever it is, as Fremont is at max capacity @RenataKonkoly Yes @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers Yes @shelbiestrykers I agree Mythic Quest is 🤣🤣 MTTD @polyrhythmic Mean Time To Dick is a key measure of any given human or machine intelligence system @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Merlin is very simple compared to Raptor @yourfavgas @VenciKudev @Tesla Width currently limited by size of cold-roll press needed to get steel to full hard condition.

Incredible! You go guys! 🐢  https://t.co/lGfPfIqqYF Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team! @SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 No problem :) @SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China. @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world @Lauren62515251 @PPathole @NateSilver538 Fair point :) @RiccitelliDylan @ColdBuschLights @PPathole @NateSilver538 Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too.  https://t.co/YKMW54q2kL @PPathole @NateSilver538 Up to 80% false positive @PPathole @NateSilver538 Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand. @NateSilver538 Do you have data on the false positive rate? I’ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”.  https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG @NateSilver538 Important consideration @blancavleon So sorry to hear this Blanca.  May the one who brings peace bring peace to all. ❤️ @JBNielsen1985 @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Both @InSpaceXItrust @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla Could maybe tap the condensation for water too. Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure, fresh water &amp; just dump it on the ground. @SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority &amp; LAX customs for acting so swiftly @SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators on Friday night &amp; airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know! @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car &amp; know when you’re expected home, so temp &amp; humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy. @romn8tr @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati This is a way bigger deal than most people realize @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Sure would love to do home hvac that’s quiet &amp; efficient, with humidity control &amp; HEPA filter @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast &amp; extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me. @ajtourville @Teslarati The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond @Teslarati Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I’ve seen in a while. Team did next-level work. @justpaulinelol @engineers_feed 🤣🤣 @BocachicaMaria1 Will do @teslaownersSV @RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page:  https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG @RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Exactly @jonkay @Quillette According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19.

Many of you must feel the same. Hang in there. Lead with love and optimism. We will be better. @POTUS, please step down or go quietly. Don’t cause more Americans to attack America.

Needed to get going on accelerating sustainable energy &amp; making life multiplanetary. @Model3Owners @TrungTPhan It took an utterly insane amount of work to move the SpaceX &amp; Tesla success probabilities above ~zero @TrungTPhan To be frank, in the early days, I thought there was &gt;90% chance that both SpaceX &amp; Tesla would be worth $0. The press &amp; aerospace / automotive industry at the time (correctly) agreed with me. @fermatslibrary Irrational is such a funny word to describe numbers @IStandWithAhmed @JesseDorogusker great meeting you Ahmed! @MiguelGamino @PopSci This is silly.

Flies end of year. @dtweiseth If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically @dtweiseth Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months. @RitaChung16 Yes @VinnyLingham Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way.

Why? So that we could donate twice their recycled value to charity!

We will learn from others. And do it in our own way @EmadDlala biggest change and improvement is weekly in timeline. It\\'s where it matters most and isn\\'t conservative @abhi_not thanks! @VettiGuy we are simplifying the experience every opportunity we see @lmlewis517 need to simplify a lot here @DellAnnaLuca we\\'ve made a lot of progress there. And yes, we will always ask and listen @EmadDlala we\\'re pretty confident @tckamdar thanks! @jonnysun thank you @BeachPhilosophy @DilliDurAst yes @codytoshiro same @jaredoban cool @abhi_not made a lot of progress here. Not, and will never be, done. @Fahad_A1 different tastes I guess but I think Reddit\\'s app is best @JGoodDFC working on that @pranay01 @cherian_abraham @Square agree we are looking into it @andrewnorton96 @Support we have that @tinab @barniebookworm looking @Fahad_A1 we haven\\'t declined and there are still a lot of amazing API developers today! @tsteele93 @e @tinab 🙏🏼 @Rodrigo22 @iamcornelias @kevin not our decision @slsamlynch always @thatadamguy 🙏🏼 @JGoodDFC talk w @kevin. His decision not ours @seinecle we have that with MIT @dkroy @ankitranka when we first started almost 11 years ago we had this. Called it \"worship\". Didn\\'t last @JGoodDFC get it. We will relook at this @seinecle considered this @GiulioST agree @alexrkonrad looking a lot at replies @peterseibel @mrdonut @kcoleman @e @tsteele93 how so? @tinab @dbinkowski @monikarun majority of our accounts are controlled/tweeted by owners @Travon looking at this @mrdonut  @kcoleman @peterseibel @thatadamguy we\\'ve explored this! @Abessinier you shouldn\\'t have to work so much for it but happy to hear it\\'s good now @JGoodDFC made progress here and lots more to do @amandaspleas we\\'ve done a lot of this. @ezrielpolatchek great! But we do need to change and improve! All good tho @monikarun yes. Need to do better there. Thanks @dbinkowski @monikarun who else would it be? @HeddiCundle false @DilliDurAst a lot of the improvements happens pretty fast given our scale. Can we move faster? Yes. @doug_ellison we have mad a lot of progress here @tsteele93 🙏🏼 @weareCURIO thanks for using it @monikarun we wanted to prep dev community @tsteele93 we should encourage more usage of two factor authorization @mikegatto agree fully w the first part! @mehulgohil happy new year to you @DilliDurAst always improving @shadez @sanjaybafna no @HeddiCundle we\\'ve built a great business so not sure what you mean @jakewertz we\\'ve made a lot of progress here. What are the specific gaps you\\'re seeing? @cybersuze did that! @fuck_off_Rat not our strength @tsteele93 not true on second point. We\\'ve worked hard to give more security options to people @maramesque that\\'s interesting @kcoleman @jakewertz what seems striaghtforward has a lot of nuance that needs to be thought through @slsamlynch the benefit is that people recognize them faster. That\\'s valuable. Little things add up @THE_47th that\\'s oddly precise @ALJVD1 @instagram @twitter have to talk to @Kevin about that. His decision not ours @pacogonzalez agree. We are working to simplify. Lots of baggage here we are steadily working through @mrdonut @DilliDurAst this isn\\'t fair. we have made steady progress here @monikarun @BWJones @dbinkowski @anildash not true. We have listened for over a year &amp; made steady progress. We have to priories &amp; sequence @scottbelsky yes! @anildash @girlsclubny done @dbinkowski @monikarun not true. We listen (but we may not always agree) @anildash thanks for the work and time spent here. Reading thinking and considering. I agree with most of your point! @MitchyD yes. We\\'ve been slower than we should. It\\'s top and we feel the urgency @travislylesnews @Square hm! Wonder how much we\\'ll need those in future @SquareCash @topexah never too late. @politwoops does a good job of this @cwarzel certainly deserved and happy to be held accountable. It\\'s important. Thanks for all the feedback and ideas. Will do a roundup tomorrow  https://t.co/hMJMZ3P0Rz @GerberKawasaki @bajshagirl @Square square and bitcoin aren\\'t competing. You\\'re thinking of the card networks and their prices @jonnysun :) @GerberKawasaki @bajshagirl @Square 2.75% is across all card types and we offer custom rates if you reach out. We also have an API @EllisMbeh yeah there\\'s a better way to organize around topics/interests. Working on it. @mrdonut @kcoleman @charlesforelle ranked by relevance? @marksalke indeed This is our most requested feature (today &amp; always). Mostly to quickly fix mistakes. Anything beyond would need to show revision history  https://t.co/fHtGNjkuEx @AMITNKALRA def do @quietswami room for both @sapphirescribe it\\'s our top priority @jessetrowe def working on this @TommayC @Square yes we have a lot more to do here @alyssahhenry @JessicaLukhele @Karabo_Mokgoko @twitter @verified @TwitterSA will look into it @tinab @nickmyer5 agree @ashleyfeinberg nah but you can quote tweet them! @HEADHONCHO that is implemented. Rolling out @mrdonut @BoredElonMusk now we\\'re talking! @emichir @Justyn yes and yes @justinbaudoin yes I\\'m definitely captivated by the local use case @mrdonut @kcoleman @5Qs_Cricketer yup working on it @jessethanley @ViperChill how specifically is it broken? @ameet @heidimiller it\\'s our top priority @mattadams_ yes we are doing that @AMITNKALRA thx bruh @mateusbandeiraa yeah first one is good. Feels more live @Maayerson not denying it. A top priority @marckz @Benzinga listening @BoredElonMusk boring. @rvalsan not into Easter eggs. And we should be much better at location context @BenAbbott9 it\\'s a small and good start. Much more to do! @MikeIsaac definitely think there\\'s something here and we\\'re considering @mrdonut @kcoleman @narendra great point @vladsavov we use Twitter constantly. And we also listen @howardlindzon ok @louissmit remembering what you\\'ve seen is interesting @kcoleman @narendra def need ton consider our routing here @PaulLomax @richardhyland it\\'s not shit. Lots of ways to improve though. And will look at mobile site discrepancy @mrdonut @Greenbaumly think you\\'d want to show that, like a revision history @plc working on both @Justyn it\\'s our top priority @rdoddala @Square need to fix this. And looking at second suggestion @cherian_abraham @Square been researching! @iankar_ @Square def looking into both @jsngr @Square yes @Grassadonia @SquareCash @thechaz @SquareCash @circlepay will look into it @Grassadonia @thechaz @Square @BitPay we tried that online. Saw 1-3 transactions a day. Probably too early @alistairmilne @Square we tried that! Didn\\'t see much. Open to that changing in future @jturmel @SqSupport working on this @alyssahhenry @DarioAtencioA @SqSupport thanks! @GerberKawasaki @bajshagirl @Square costs for what? Swiping? Square Cash? Who has lower? @bajshagirl @Square working on it! @SquareCash @luisassardo @Square our register is, lots of work to do on payments! @fredd @Square done! @Cameron @Square we did that. Didn\\'t see a lot of activity. Perhaps that will change. Would love to see digital currency rise @readDanwrite yes team is working on this @mkargar_ca great and something we\\'re considering @p4miller @jhyu @Square it\\'s an option the seller can turn on or off. Give them your feedback! @MunaAbuSulayman def want to improve and simplify tweetstorm compose @JL_Braden experience comes first. Looking into how to better identify bots @GenELECTR1C you can turn off notifications for any convo now @rhoml simple. Working on it (and search) @mcbennett def focused on our eng tools @eyeseewaters @KatzAndrewS independent of that, yes. We strive to be the first place you hear of something happening @mrdonut @leslieberland @yashitweets thank you for the trust! @gracie @jasminelep :) @kcoleman @mrdonut @andymauro @chrismessina yes. Lots of work to do w onboarding. @mrdonut @gracie @dannysullivan @AnthonyQuintano will always start small and learn and iterate fast @mrdonut @kcoleman @Adam hi Adam! Yes. We need to be more topic-forward @balsayegh or maybe identify bots? @MunaAbuSulayman save is definitely something we\\'re considering! @DustinHurst for what and how much? @AntCole thanks. That\\'s a good one @mrdonut @The_News_DIVA we need to refine our verification program @aliyali2016 have to talk with @kevin for that one! @onefishtwobitch hey @judithclegg working on it! @brsabel @lastknight yes lots of exciting potential there @kcoleman @SkyChrisCreegan we do allow longer for partners. Removing that limit for all has a number of ramifications that we have to consider @petepachal yes we can be better here. Moments was a good but small start @Abdul3ziiz_Moh lots of people want the same! @msg will investigate @mrdonut @brsabel way to use mute for this eventuall @peterseibel @harmonicait yup! @carljonas definitely need to focus more on topics! @athrazhur I hear you. Love the authenticity in the moment @Jason @AnthonyQuintano can address that with changelog @AJ thank you! Definitely a lot of work to do on signup! @mrdonut @kcoleman @donie yeah we dropped the ball here. Will rethink. And agree on need to serve journalists better! @mrdonut @kcoleman @gracie How to navigate dating in the new vaccinated world…  https://t.co/bo9HRGZurs Yeah….I’m not going to do that.  https://t.co/ccBzjGR3iA I can’t thank Fauci enough for everything he’s done to work to keep us safe!  https://t.co/SoOLnucOBD @Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @NASASpaceflight Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it’s not a gamechanger. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster @ashleevance Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous. @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level.   Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff. @Astro_Soichi ♥️ 🇯🇵 @aramyth Nothing was taken away... we still offer mobile without boarders. @art_lucero let’s look into aramyth’s specific issues @mickeymjay Why?

Yup. “Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals.

In some cases, 60% empty. @RationalEtienne @PPathole @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action. @Erdayastronaut @BnOrdhaug @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck Sure @Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet … @nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps. @KeithMansfield @Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck That’s for sure! 😅 @Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 😀 @PPathole @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla My (again) personal favorite is  https://t.co/rM1MqsVsr1 @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle. @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2.  https://t.co/pEPVJi56Vg @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @sivanithu @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee SN26 @cabral_psyd @sivanithu @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor! @PPathole @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away! @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US. @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage.  https://t.co/2IUnS5DPOg @Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%. @davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated! @davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!! @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing. @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test. @SciGuySpace True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they’d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying. @actbrilliant Yep, that\\'s the plan and thinking, of course once it\\'s fully safe to do so. @actbrilliant Trying to figure out as we speak, but likely some hybrid: more virtual, more flexibility, hiring from more places, but still have office hubs in major geos. But we’re in the lucky category of companies that can operate fully in the cloud. There\\'s plenty to figure out around the future of work. It\\'s a safe bet that things won\\'t be exactly like before, but equally offices won\\'t fully disappear either. What is likely is companies go more virtual, more agile, have flexible hours, and aim to attract talent anywhere. New balls please!

The “unable to account for” number does not refer to actual lost children.

That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing” @RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact “All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond” @RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact This Washington Post article seems good  https://t.co/R1d9ixg179 @GetMyGist As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death &amp; hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe &amp; open to all. @xkcdComic This doesn’t take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla. @bizwiz1980 @xkcdComic A billion at most, so 20% max. Still basically in the nick of time from an age-of-Earth standpoint. @lazarusrang Humanity is not perfect, but it’s all we’ve got @xkcdComic Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old &amp; sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took 10% longer, it wouldn’t have happened at all. @docjkcardinal @WorldAndScience Let’s find out.

Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm it’s valid &amp; park. @rarelyserious @Tesla Cool haha @Cointelegraph This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.  When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions. @ajtourville The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets!   We have a few ideas for increasing torque &amp; max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun &amp; exciting engineering ahead! @ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel).   Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration. @ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.  Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion.   Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator. @AlternateJones True It’s time to use pragmatism not ideology to tackle North America’s opioid crisis  https://t.co/DwKyejvmYh  https://t.co/wXvZw5cTBh Why leaders need to create a company culture:  https://t.co/zDBN2tsCM6 #ReadbyRichard  https://t.co/MehEeMIYMm I\\'m a huge lover of the great outdoors so thrilled to invest in @SMr_gear on @ABCSharkTank  https://t.co/awLb5qPjWL #SharkTank  https://t.co/V1bdwW9tRT Sorry to see Monarch go into administration.

Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal. @flcnhvy To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs. @raytech247 @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case) @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg. @Kristennetten @lexfridman @joerogan 🤣🤣 @esecrist50 @Kristennetten @Erdayastronaut @YoavOffek That’s pretty much what happened.

The key is just to say no to these things and build the product you’d want to use. 90% of the world’s software complexity would go away if product managers had to go back to the drawing board anytime they think to themselves “I’m sure people can figure this out”. @newscientist @XHNews Congratulations to China on the successful launch of the LM 5 heavy lift rocket! @brainwipe There would def be millions of agents simultaneously doing a Monte Carlo sim &amp; combining the results to build a map of weaknesses @ClintonKeith good chance Only a matter of time before advanced AI is used to do this.

Enterprise software design has always traditionally lagged consumer technology, by years. Now, we’re regularly seeing enterprise software that is more thoughtful and simple than the consumer space. We’re still early, but this is an incredible trend. If you have to stop streaming @ArianaGrande, you’re clearly lost!

Where would I put @LegereDoll’s ego?!?  https://t.co/6ffxrdGvUo Hmm, do you think I could make a @TMobile logo??? 🤔 https://t.co/klm4dRWMWq @JonAttenborough @cFidd Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else & directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them. @ollie_turrell @cFidd Pretty much @Snipergen @Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better & more fun. This is an alpha version. @cFidd No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic & it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is. @RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted. @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net. @amargosavalley Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting. @ToscaMusk @kimbal ❤️ you too sis @SMZGallagher @Tesla Sorry about this. We will do our best. The Tesla production & delivery teams have been working super hard. @JohnnaCrider1 @mayemusk Literally. It was at 40th & Baltimore in Philadelphia before gentrification. @JaneidyEve @johnkrausphotos @austinbarnard45 @flcnhvy @Joe__Wakefield @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo Ramones & Bach @johnkrausphotos @austinbarnard45 @flcnhvy @Joe__Wakefield @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo I hope someone has pics! My Mom came to visit one weekend & was quite surprised by it all, but helped work coat check & guarded the cash with a kitchen knife 🤣🤣 @austinbarnard45 @flcnhvy @Joe__Wakefield @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo To pay rent, we turned our house into a nightclub & charged a $5 entry fee. Looked cool at night, but insane by day … blacklights, luminescent spray paint & metal junk sculptures. @kimbal 🖤 you too @catmonocle69 Sounds like a Marxist with style @flcnhvy @cyrusposting Exactly @cyrusposting Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone. @Joe__Wakefield @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack & suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan & a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship & debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton & Stanford. @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal? @IrinaAntony @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro & ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).  My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced & round would’ve happened anyway. @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo He didn’t own an emerald mine & I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night & website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from? @geofficient Pretty much @annerajb @justpaulinelol Federal @justpaulinelol @annerajb Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals. @annerajb Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.

Other variants will have throttle. @bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle & no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year. @bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force! @jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much @leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting & inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far). @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous & difficult than Earth & take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go? @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city @Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard. @flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half @flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles & each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year @RPMTESLA Would be good to look up electricity rates by location & optimize cost automatically @tesla_truth Yeah, they were a little off the mark  https://t.co/yqZhvkbdrt @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Fun! @cleantechnica Applies to a small number of Bay Area residents, but worth checking out Hopefully a lot of this comes in magenta 🥶  https://t.co/U4SxbQIbZI Meet Tobias, a 7-year-old Chihuahua who enjoys walks outside in between his couch potato time 🛋🥔 Head to @SeattleHumane to meet him today! @Jesspenafornes @JonFreier @JEMartel @WencyBaerga @cburgos72 @solcorujo wooo hoo!!!

My greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid & full reusability, without which we shall forever be confined to Earth. @Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp) @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Higher Isp too @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust & propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters & they’re already there @brendan2908 @NASASpaceflight Yes @mikko @Darudevil It’s true!

Deaths should be broken out as died with vs died of. @teslaownersSV @kimbal Deaths continue to trend down  https://t.co/FsZNwkvs1H @kimbal We’re seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives, in range of 5% to 10%. Article says testing went from 100k to 600k, which means a 6-fold increase in false positives. My guess is most cases, especially “no symptoms”, are false positives. @WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave Yes @flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave The news is sometimes created, but always curated. The latter is most pernicious. On any given day, there are thousands of potential stories. By picking which stories are written about & how prominently they’re placed, a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative. @flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave Klippenstein has gone full twitter troll.

Will improve a lot in coming months. @slye @LivingTesla @Tesla Impressive analysis @LivingTesla @Tesla Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we’ll add a setting to disable internal camera. @LivingTesla @Tesla Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows & rear window. @LivingTesla @Tesla It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft & people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet.

At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all. 2019: Why in the world do we still own a printer at home, this is a complete waste of space.  2020: This is the most important asset we own, and I will barter with you to use it right now. My latest Zoom background is a picture of a Peloton so people think I’m staying fit while working from home. “We’re looking at sending checks to Americans, immediately” - Steve Mnuchin. Glad we’re taking this seriously. Where is the Love?  Anti-Semitism. Anti-Palestinian. Anti-Asian. Anti-Muslim. Anti-Armenian. Anti-Black. Anti-LGBTQ. Anti-Christian. Anti-Latino. Anti-Jew.

Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps. @yourloyalpal @SComet04 @WSJ Deal Please support my campaign to rebrand @WSJ as 🧦 emoji! @AustinOnSocial @TheOnion 🔥🔥💕💕💫💫😀😀 At some point, @TheOnion and I should just a get a room … @techreview Just use this handy guide  https://t.co/wWZGuNpe5f @sanjeev_r11 @cleantechnica @lexfridman Yes @cleantechnica Good interview by @lexfridman @Louisbotelho17 @Kristennetten @arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement Truth @johnrobb Exactly @Kristennetten @arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement How embarrassing.

They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil, coal & gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels … @langstonwertzjr @TMobile email me to experience the best!  John.Legere@T-mobile.com Thank you @AGRutledge!

Proud to support the #LGBTQ community!! #UnlimitedPride  https://t.co/8YkcJ0sQxT For all those people (me) who take hundreds of photos at a time.  https://t.co/nvkCqt3OdV Life goals, #amiright?  https://t.co/gIH0ZDC8gh It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler. @karaswisher Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse. @kenlacovara Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms & partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly) Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible? @SeanGVarney That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term. We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far … Artificial intelligence.  https://t.co/jo7CLUSNEg Congrats @babson #1 entrepreneur program on your amazing new Salesforce applicant admissions platform!   https://t.co/CmyCdGkcMH  https://t.co/uQNrs6kGfG You can achieve great career success and change the world at the same time – @HollyBranson’s book #WEconomy shares how  https://t.co/PJDNR0vCMX @MarcKielburger @CraigKielburger  https://t.co/04tZ9rnLWb .@HollyBranson’s book WEcomony shares how when purpose and profit are combined, it has the power to change the world  https://t.co/PJDNR0vCMX @MarcKielburger @CraigKielburger  https://t.co/pcLqorIZoI So proud of @HollyBranson for writing her first book #WEconomy  https://t.co/PJDNR0vCMX  https://t.co/D2QH8VvzXQ The entrepreneurial creative process an idea goes through:  https://t.co/eiyYbupNR5 #MondayMotivation  https://t.co/972qDeQSWT Voted!

Also, whereas phone batteries make heavy use of cobalt in cathode, Tesla uses primarily nickel, which is trickier, but has better energy density (range).

Hawthorne is working on SN5 now, but focus is ramping build rate of SN6 through SN10. @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight The opposite. Any insights gained by one team must be shared with the other, but other team not required to use them. @space_terp @NASASpaceflight Both sites will make many Starships. This is a competition to see which location is most effective. Answer might be both. @NASASpaceflight SpaceX is doing simultaneous competing builds of Starship in Boca Chica Texas & Cape Canaveral Florida @Robotbeat @justpaulinelol @Teslarati Sure. Have to do it on Mars from beginning. Will ultimately do that on Earth too, so rocket flights will be zero net carbon long-term. @TeslaTested @Teslarati Next quarter @TeslaTested @Teslarati Will discuss with my product team next week, but probably @justpaulinelol @Teslarati Yes @Teslarati Great work by SpaceX parachute engineering!

As I read it, this wasn’t a call for civil war (author used as a provocative metaphor) or a one party system (author states both parties still exist), but a bunch of learnings and warnings for both parties. I disagree both parties can’t work together. I thought this was a strong analysis and thesis of competing economic systems in the past (labor) and today (energy), where one ideology had to win completely to move us all forward. I’ve been getting a lot of critical feedback on this tweet. Fair.

Please spend at least 8 seconds checking your facts. @businessinsider Just because I have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn\\'t make me a ninja. That requires years of training. @VatsalSngh @businessinsider There are dozens of bogus or half-true anecdotes don\\'t really matter & maybe 5 to 10 that do. Guess I could post for those interested. @businessinsider One other I\\'d like to correct from the biography: I never said I was a samurai. Said I was ninja. No, that\\'s a joke. Didn\\'t say that either. @businessinsider MB was given 52 weeks of salary & stock in appreciation for her great contribution & left to join a small firm, once again as a generalist @businessinsider Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over 10 yrs, but as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs one generalist @businessinsider Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense. @businessinsider Ashlee Vance\\'s biography is mostly correct, but also rife with errors & never independently fact-checked, despite my request that he do so Thank you @CoryBooker @PattyArquette @DarrenAronofsky @Neilyoung for visionary humanitarian leadership on #NoDAPL.  https://t.co/ttXptWKhI0 Congratulations @adidas for showing all of us the way forward together as Trailblazers.   https://t.co/zNzNeExnyd Strange, but true Bitcoin\\'s energy use is expected to double again by the end of the year, according to a new peer-reviewed study out Wednesday.

An always-in-your-pocket device will never be safe enough to be solely responsible for your bitcoin. Whether through accidental loss, theft, or in worst cases coercion, having some friction here is beneficial. What’s the right friction? With that, @jessedorogusker, I, and team will listen and continue the conversation. And we’ll set up a dedicated Twitter and github account if we decide to build. We’ll update this thread with that information when we’re ready. Thanks! 12/Cash App integration is obvious for us but only part of the solution. A smooth experience likely depends on a custom-built app but it doesn’t need to be owned by Square. We can imagine apps that work without Square and maybe also without permission from Apple and Google. You? 11/Layer 2 is essential for growth. The orders-of-magnitude growth we imagine requires a mix of custodial, off-chain, and second layer solutions that allow people to ‘get off of 0.’ What tech investments can enable seamless, scalable, L2 native support for a hardware wallet? 10/Trust can’t be required. Today, customers depend heavily on the continued function of infrastructure provided by 3rd parties. We want mainstream customers to be able to lean on us when they want to, but we won’t exclude those who don’t. How should we think about this flow? 9/Are small displays necessary? Expecting mainstream customers to validate details on a small display is *unlikely* to increase security and *likely* to reduce device reliability, increase device cost, and decrease accessibility. Is the product better if a display isn\\'t required? 8/Today’s recovery mechanisms burn money. Customers have to protect recovery information from damage, loss, and theft and store secret(s). In practice, this is not yet mainstream-ready. We don’t want more passwords on post-its. What best of class solutions should we consider? 7/Safety is complicated. For any wallet product, we consider safety failures to stem from one of three types of events: availability failures (“sunken gold”), security failures (“pirated gold”), and discretionary actions (“confiscated gold”). What threats are we missing? 6/Blend availability and security. Make it easy for customers to keep the funds they want quick access to at their fingertips, spendable with phone-only permissions, while keeping the remainder under tighter, less available but more secure controls. What’s the right balance? 4/Most people access the internet on mobile. Any solution we build must provide an excellent experience when using mobile, despite its shortcomings and liabilities. An uncompromising focus on mobile interaction is likely to include the most people. What are the dangers here? 4/Most people access the internet on mobile. Any solution we build must provide an excellent experience when using mobile, despite its shortcomings and liabilities. An uncompromising focus on mobile interaction is likely to include the most people. What are the dangers here? 3/Custody doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing. We can probably simplify custody through “assisted self-custody.” Assisted requires great product design: minimal setup time, relying on existing devices, and end-to-end reliability. How should we be thinking about assisted solutions? 2/“No keys, no cheese.” The exchange you used to buy your bitcoin probably attends to your security with good intent, but circumstances may reveal “custody” actually means “IOU.” Deciding to take custody, and security, of your bitcoin is complicated. What’s the #1 problem here? 1/Bitcoin is for everyone. It’s important to us to build an inclusive product that brings a non-custodial solution to the global market. Much respect to everyone who has gotten us this far. What are the biggest blockers to get a non-custodial solution to the next 100M people? Square is considering making a hardware wallet for #bitcoin. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community. We want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles. @fjpou @Google @TMobile You need to check out our deals then! @ManUpGary You’ll have to follow me for that! @Rschiedel @TMobile  https://t.co/kFFGd0AUdx #LIVE @TMobile CEO: Happy Sunday!

This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially. @Off_thewalls @MKBHD @joerogan A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady. @VHollywood21 Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing. @MKBHD Will do @bartjehoel @djenkins6 Correct, pure electric.

Here’s my thoughts:  https://t.co/wk2f9O5HfK  https://t.co/dJJ6AEGNQd @28delayslater @justpaulinelol Dogecoin Mode @PPathole @CBSNewYork @AielloTV Great @harsha_irugu 👍 🤣 @CBSNewYork @AielloTV Heard same from doc I trust @yourfavgas @justpaulinelol No, good chance of RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event, but landing pad is separated from launch pad @justpaulinelol That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change! So often true 🤣🤣  https://t.co/qxmDtZ4Buf @brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time & reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production. @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight These won’t be strictly coupled to ship serial number. Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder. @PPathole Great labeling tools & talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools & infrastructure is underrated. @jh_csquared @AlexBrendel2 @Erdayastronaut As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is >1000% harder than designing it @RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It’s also because of the Spitfire engine & wizard @PPathole Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term. @jgrano305 @thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica Progress is good @thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica Definitely @cleantechnica Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame & actuation. @DMC_Ryan @RenataKonkoly Sure, we can probably do an update later this year @Kristennetten @PPathole @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers Needs to be more than halfway to east coast @PPathole @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers Not saying new Giga will be in Texas, but Cybertruck will be produced there wherever it is, as Fremont is at max capacity @RenataKonkoly Yes @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers Yes @shelbiestrykers I agree Mythic Quest is 🤣🤣 MTTD @polyrhythmic Mean Time To Dick is a key measure of any given human or machine intelligence system @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Merlin is very simple compared to Raptor @yourfavgas @VenciKudev @Tesla Width currently limited by size of cold-roll press needed to get steel to full hard condition. Bigger press will be built long-term. @VenciKudev @Tesla Absolutely Great questions from Hack Club! @bborrman @leslieberland thank you Brandon!

Very impressive team! @SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 No problem :) @SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe & should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China. @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world @Lauren62515251 @PPathole @NateSilver538 Fair point :) @RiccitelliDylan @ColdBuschLights @PPathole @NateSilver538 Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too.  https://t.co/YKMW54q2kL @PPathole @NateSilver538 Up to 80% false positive @PPathole @NateSilver538 Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases & using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand. @NateSilver538 Do you have data on the false positive rate? I’ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”.  https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG @NateSilver538 Important consideration @blancavleon So sorry to hear this Blanca.  May the one who brings peace bring peace to all. ❤️ @JBNielsen1985 @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Both @InSpaceXItrust @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla Could maybe tap the condensation for water too. Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure, fresh water & just dump it on the ground. @SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority & LAX customs for acting so swiftly @SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know! @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car & know when you’re expected home, so temp & humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy. @romn8tr @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati This is a way bigger deal than most people realize @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Sure would love to do home hvac that’s quiet & efficient, with humidity control & HEPA filter @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast & extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me. @ajtourville @Teslarati The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond @Teslarati Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I’ve seen in a while. Team did next-level work. @justpaulinelol @engineers_feed 🤣🤣 @BocachicaMaria1 Will do @teslaownersSV @RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page:  https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG @RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Exactly @jonkay @Quillette According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19.

Why? So that we could donate twice their recycled value to charity!

We will learn from others. And do it in our own way @EmadDlala biggest change and improvement is weekly in timeline. It\\'s where it matters most and isn\\'t conservative @abhi_not thanks! @VettiGuy we are simplifying the experience every opportunity we see @lmlewis517 need to simplify a lot here @DellAnnaLuca we\\'ve made a lot of progress there. And yes, we will always ask and listen @EmadDlala we\\'re pretty confident @tckamdar thanks! @jonnysun thank you @BeachPhilosophy @DilliDurAst yes @codytoshiro same @jaredoban cool @abhi_not made a lot of progress here. Not, and will never be, done. @Fahad_A1 different tastes I guess but I think Reddit\\'s app is best @JGoodDFC working on that @pranay01 @cherian_abraham @Square agree we are looking into it @andrewnorton96 @Support we have that @tinab @barniebookworm looking @Fahad_A1 we haven\\'t declined and there are still a lot of amazing API developers today! @tsteele93 @e @tinab 🙏🏼 @Rodrigo22 @iamcornelias @kevin not our decision @slsamlynch always @thatadamguy 🙏🏼 @JGoodDFC talk w @kevin. His decision not ours @seinecle we have that with MIT @dkroy @ankitranka when we first started almost 11 years ago we had this. Called it \"worship\". Didn\\'t last @JGoodDFC get it. We will relook at this @seinecle considered this @GiulioST agree @alexrkonrad looking a lot at replies @peterseibel @mrdonut @kcoleman @e @tsteele93 how so? @tinab @dbinkowski @monikarun majority of our accounts are controlled/tweeted by owners @Travon looking at this @mrdonut  @kcoleman @peterseibel @thatadamguy we\\'ve explored this! @Abessinier you shouldn\\'t have to work so much for it but happy to hear it\\'s good now @JGoodDFC made progress here and lots more to do @amandaspleas we\\'ve done a lot of this. @ezrielpolatchek great! But we do need to change and improve! All good tho @monikarun yes. Need to do better there. Thanks @dbinkowski @monikarun who else would it be? @HeddiCundle false @DilliDurAst a lot of the improvements happens pretty fast given our scale. Can we move faster? Yes. @doug_ellison we have mad a lot of progress here @tsteele93 🙏🏼 @weareCURIO thanks for using it @monikarun we wanted to prep dev community @tsteele93 we should encourage more usage of two factor authorization @mikegatto agree fully w the first part! @mehulgohil happy new year to you @DilliDurAst always improving @shadez @sanjaybafna no @HeddiCundle we\\'ve built a great business so not sure what you mean @jakewertz we\\'ve made a lot of progress here. What are the specific gaps you\\'re seeing? @cybersuze did that! @fuck_off_Rat not our strength @tsteele93 not true on second point. We\\'ve worked hard to give more security options to people @maramesque that\\'s interesting @kcoleman @jakewertz what seems striaghtforward has a lot of nuance that needs to be thought through @slsamlynch the benefit is that people recognize them faster. That\\'s valuable. Little things add up @THE_47th that\\'s oddly precise @ALJVD1 @instagram @twitter have to talk to @Kevin about that. His decision not ours @pacogonzalez agree. We are working to simplify. Lots of baggage here we are steadily working through @mrdonut @DilliDurAst this isn\\'t fair. we have made steady progress here @monikarun @BWJones @dbinkowski @anildash not true. We have listened for over a year & made steady progress. We have to priories & sequence @scottbelsky yes! @anildash @girlsclubny done @dbinkowski @monikarun not true. We listen (but we may not always agree) @anildash thanks for the work and time spent here. Reading thinking and considering. I agree with most of your point! @MitchyD yes. We\\'ve been slower than we should. It\\'s top and we feel the urgency @travislylesnews @Square hm! Wonder how much we\\'ll need those in future @SquareCash @topexah never too late. @politwoops does a good job of this @cwarzel certainly deserved and happy to be held accountable. It\\'s important.

We also have an API @EllisMbeh yeah there\\'s a better way to organize around topics/interests. Working on it. @mrdonut @kcoleman @charlesforelle ranked by relevance? @marksalke indeed This is our most requested feature (today & always). Mostly to quickly fix mistakes. Anything beyond would need to show revision history  https://t.co/fHtGNjkuEx @AMITNKALRA def do @quietswami room for both @sapphirescribe it\\'s our top priority @jessetrowe def working on this @TommayC @Square yes we have a lot more to do here @alyssahhenry @JessicaLukhele @Karabo_Mokgoko @twitter @verified @TwitterSA will look into it @tinab @nickmyer5 agree @ashleyfeinberg nah but you can quote tweet them! @HEADHONCHO that is implemented.

Feels more live @Maayerson not denying it. A top priority @marckz @Benzinga listening @BoredElonMusk boring. @rvalsan not into Easter eggs. And we should be much better at location context @BenAbbott9 it\\'s a small and good start. Much more to do! @MikeIsaac definitely think there\\'s something here and we\\'re considering @mrdonut @kcoleman @narendra great point @vladsavov we use Twitter constantly. And we also listen @howardlindzon ok @louissmit remembering what you\\'ve seen is interesting @kcoleman @narendra def need ton consider our routing here @PaulLomax @richardhyland it\\'s not shit. Lots of ways to improve though. And will look at mobile site discrepancy @mrdonut @Greenbaumly think you\\'d want to show that, like a revision history @plc working on both @Justyn it\\'s our top priority @rdoddala @Square need to fix this. And looking at second suggestion @cherian_abraham @Square been researching! @iankar_ @Square def looking into both @jsngr @Square yes @Grassadonia @SquareCash @thechaz @SquareCash @circlepay will look into it @Grassadonia @thechaz @Square @BitPay we tried that online.

Didn\\'t see a lot of activity. Perhaps that will change. Would love to see digital currency rise @readDanwrite yes team is working on this @mkargar_ca great and something we\\'re considering @p4miller @jhyu @Square it\\'s an option the seller can turn on or off. Give them your feedback! @MunaAbuSulayman def want to improve and simplify tweetstorm compose @JL_Braden experience comes first. Looking into how to better identify bots @GenELECTR1C you can turn off notifications for any convo now @rhoml simple. Working on it (and search) @mcbennett def focused on our eng tools @eyeseewaters @KatzAndrewS independent of that, yes. We strive to be the first place you hear of something happening @mrdonut @leslieberland @yashitweets thank you for the trust! @gracie @jasminelep :) @kcoleman @mrdonut @andymauro @chrismessina yes. Lots of work to do w onboarding. @mrdonut @gracie @dannysullivan @AnthonyQuintano will always start small and learn and iterate fast @mrdonut @kcoleman @Adam hi Adam! Yes. We need to be more topic-forward @balsayegh or maybe identify bots? @MunaAbuSulayman save is definitely something we\\'re considering! @DustinHurst for what and how much? @AntCole thanks. That\\'s a good one @mrdonut @The_News_DIVA we need to refine our verification program @aliyali2016 have to talk with @kevin for that one! @onefishtwobitch hey @judithclegg working on it! @brsabel @lastknight yes lots of exciting potential there @kcoleman @SkyChrisCreegan we do allow longer for partners. Removing that limit for all has a number of ramifications that we have to consider @petepachal yes we can be better here.

Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it’s not a gamechanger. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster @ashleevance Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous. @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level.   Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff. @Astro_Soichi ♥️ 🇯🇵 @aramyth Nothing was taken away... we still offer mobile without boarders. @art_lucero let’s look into aramyth’s specific issues @mickeymjay Why?

Yup. “Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation & you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable. @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter Sounds about right  https://t.co/pEPVJi56Vg @dschless @Bob_Wachter Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%.

Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets & is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle. @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat & driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved!

Even NY is giving them away! @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage & payload separation system also not US. @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips & Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation & setting PEEP & O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage.  https://t.co/2IUnS5DPOg @Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%. @davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated! @davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!! @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often & is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing. @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test. @SciGuySpace True. Only reason other medium & heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they’d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying. @actbrilliant Yep, that\\'s the plan and thinking, of course once it\\'s fully safe to do so. @actbrilliant Trying to figure out as we speak, but likely some hybrid: more virtual, more flexibility, hiring from more places, but still have office hubs in major geos. But we’re in the lucky category of companies that can operate fully in the cloud. There\\'s plenty to figure out around the future of work. It\\'s a safe bet that things won\\'t be exactly like before, but equally offices won\\'t fully disappear either. What is likely is companies go more virtual, more agile, have flexible hours, and aim to attract talent anywhere. New balls please!

The “unable to account for” number does not refer to actual lost children.

That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing” @RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact “All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond” @RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact This Washington Post article seems good  https://t.co/R1d9ixg179 @GetMyGist As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death & hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe & open to all. @xkcdComic This doesn’t take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla. @bizwiz1980 @xkcdComic A billion at most, so 20% max. Still basically in the nick of time from an age-of-Earth standpoint. @lazarusrang Humanity is not perfect, but it’s all we’ve got @xkcdComic Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old & sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took 10% longer, it wouldn’t have happened at all. @docjkcardinal @WorldAndScience Let’s find out.

Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm it’s valid & park. @rarelyserious @Tesla Cool haha @Cointelegraph This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.  When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions. @ajtourville The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets!   We have a few ideas for increasing torque & max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun & exciting engineering ahead! @ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel).   Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration. @ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.  Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion.   Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator. @AlternateJones True It’s time to use pragmatism not ideology to tackle North America’s opioid crisis  https://t.co/DwKyejvmYh  https://t.co/wXvZw5cTBh Why leaders need to create a company culture:  https://t.co/zDBN2tsCM6 #ReadbyRichard  https://t.co/MehEeMIYMm I\\'m a huge lover of the great outdoors so thrilled to invest in @SMr_gear on @ABCSharkTank  https://t.co/awLb5qPjWL #SharkTank  https://t.co/V1bdwW9tRT Sorry to see Monarch go into administration.

Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal. @flcnhvy To be clear, I do think finance & law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs. @raytech247 @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case) @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 & 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg. @Kristennetten @lexfridman @joerogan 🤣🤣 @esecrist50 @Kristennetten @Erdayastronaut @YoavOffek That’s pretty much what happened.

The key is just to say no to these things and build the product you’d want to use. 90% of the world’s software complexity would go away if product managers had to go back to the drawing board anytime they think to themselves “I’m sure people can figure this out”. @newscientist @XHNews Congratulations to China on the successful launch of the LM 5 heavy lift rocket! @brainwipe There would def be millions of agents simultaneously doing a Monte Carlo sim & combining the results to build a map of weaknesses @ClintonKeith good chance Only a matter of time before advanced AI is used to do this.
