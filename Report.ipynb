    "In August of 2018, Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Telsa, sent out the tweet \"Am considering taking Telsa private at \\\\$420. Funding secured.\" The result of this tweet was a $40M fine, Musk losing his chair at Telsa, and an 11% increase of Tesla's stock price at the day's close [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of his censurship, Musk continued send out tweets that directly impacted his own company's stocks. And in 2020, Telsa's stock fell sharply by 10.8% at the close when Musk tweeted \"Telsa stock price is too high imo\" [2]. Investors that have, in the past, carefully done their due diligence in deciding how to allocate their funds are now faced with this new element in how stocks perform: that of social media. Highly influential individuals can, and have, voiced their opinions on the market through various social media platforms, causing prices to rise or fall within hours of publication, and many have claimed this to be outright market manipulation, calling for regulators to get involved. Nonetheless, today's investing strategies now have to rely on closely monitoring social media to alert them for these instances. The rapid market changes from these tweets has caused investors to be fixated on monitoring social media for similar occurrences. "

Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment. @EvotoRentals Yes @FredericLambert I don’t have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private.

Despite this, the tweet is discussing Virgin Galactic directly, so not only is it surprising that it correctly predicted no change, but that there was actually no associated change with the stock. The words design, spaceflight, spaceport, and take are associated with stock changes, but oddly flight itself is associated with no cahnges.
